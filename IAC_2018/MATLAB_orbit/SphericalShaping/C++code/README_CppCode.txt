% Spherical Shaping Method written in C++

% Contains: spherical shaping algorithm, its application to single transfer and to GTOC2. 
Does not contain optimal control part.

% The code is written using functions from TUDAT, the toolbox of Delft, so they would work only with that toolbox unless equivalent functions 
are replaced to the TUDAT functions.

% The structure of the function is identical to the Matlab structure.

    where the letter 'v' denotes a vertex and the letter 'f' denotes a        
    triangular facet.  The VERTEX_TABLE is the first part, describing the     
    positions of the vertices of the shape model.  The floating point         
    numbers x1 y1 z1 are the coordinates of vertex 1, and so on (vertices     
    are implicitly numbered beginning with 1).  The origin is the center      
    of mass, and the axes are the principle axes of the shape model.  The     
    units are kilometers.  The linking of vertices into facets is provided    
    in the FACET_TABLE.                                                       
                                                                              
    This format is identical to a Wavefront OBJ file.  There is a freeware    
    program called WCVT2POV that will convert this format into other formats  
    such as POVray and DXF.

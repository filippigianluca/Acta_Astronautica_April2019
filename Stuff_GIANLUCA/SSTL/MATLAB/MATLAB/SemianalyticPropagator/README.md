- main files: 'Propagator_Earth', for averaged analytical propagation in an 
               Earth-centered reference system;
              'Propagator_Interplanetary', for averaged analytical 
               propagation in a Sun-centered reference system.

- tool: the folder contains the files required to propagate the orbit of a 
        spacecraft using an averaged analytical propagator. The propagator 
        includes perturbations due to low-thrust acceleration (constant 
        tangential acceleration, constant acceleration in a rth reference frame),
        J2, J3, J4, J5, atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, Sun and Moon.
